Hello! My name is Jonathan and I'm fairly new to programming. I learned how to use Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python through school, but I am looking to expand my skillset
through practice.

For work, I have been bartending for the past six years and am looking to move on from that. I am completing some prerequisite math courses so I can attend university (again) to
complete my degree in computer science. I'm looking to focus on data science throughout my education because I have a decent background in it and I genuinely enjoy it.

My interests include fantasy novels, technology, education and hockey. Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile!
